<h2>When Are We Gonna Have a Serious Conversation About How Unserious (and Problematic) SIGCSE Is? (Response Thesis)</h2>
 
 <p>I have been in a situation similar to Dr. Nicki Washington. These people are clearly in the wrong. However, do you believe that this is a great opportunity to teach people so they can learn from this situation or do you ignore the situation completely?</p>

 <p>Within Computer Science thousands of workers never went to a university however does this make them less qualified? Why do you think the panelist's minds are set on you having to go to college and get tenure?</p>

 <p>With all of the panelists whose job is it to make people with different perspectives and coming from different backgrounds.</p>

 <p>Within the article “technical depth” is thrown around heavily. Depth is defined as “extensive and detailed study or knowledge” and technology is defined as “relating to a particular subject, art, or craft, or its techniques”(Technical, Oxford Languages) (Depth, Oxford Languages).</p>

 <p>When writing anything it is good to assume that the audience knows nothing about the topic. Do you believe that when you're talking to smart scholars that you should explain the simple thing over again or should you just cut to the chase?</p>

 <p>Toward the end of the article, it brings up that one of the panelists thinks that this does not help the CS community. Sometimes things are not going to help the CS community, instead, it is a person's passion or another community that this person belongs to. It is good to remember that projects can be just for fun and still be used in a scholarly manner.</p>

 <p>The paper describes the format that the panelist wants. This could not be inclusive to everyone because certain scholarly papers are going to need more information than others.</p>

 <p>If these panelists went through inclusive classes do you believe that their opinions would be less or the same amount of bias?</p>

 <p>As a person of ethnicity, there are many times I have had to deal with racist stereotypes but if you're a woman as well you also have to deal with misogynistic people. Do you believe there are any ways to prevent this?</p>

 <p>Could not know whether this person would help create no bias or just looking at the research would create no bias within the workforce. </p>

 <p>Would having more diversity within the work environment change the idea and make an unbiased work environment?</p>

 <p>Should the peer review system change for people who are not well-known or famous scholars so there are new ideas and new ways of doing things?</p>

 <p>Is there any feedback that was not out of a white or elitist mindset? If so, do you think she could have changed this?</p>

 <p>When hiring these panelists one of the requirements is to be understanding, and unbiased and make an inclusive environment. It also needs to be testable to make sure that you are making the correct decisions.</p>

 <p>Another way they could create less bias within the peer review system would be by offering paid inclusive training to make inclusive decisions and not looking down on ethnic groups as well as women. </p>
