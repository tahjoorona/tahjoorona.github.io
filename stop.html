<h3> STOP Summary </h3>
<head>
<body> 
    <p>Traffic offenses have decreased from 2019 to 2020 probably due to COVID-19 stay at home protocol. It can also be due to the fact that there were less police forces focusing on traffic and more focus on BLM protests and making sure that no one gets hurt. </p>

    <p>The most common offense is speeding accounting for 43% of all offenses. Which makes sense because most people that I know slightly speed. </p>

    <p>DUI has decreased by 36% which shows that they are going in the right way. However, it still accounts for 12% of all traffic offenses. </p>

    <p>Seat Belt usage has slightly increased with 97.8% of all drivers and passengers using them. There is no more information on who is not wearing a seatbelt. I am curious to know if it is in a rural place or city. There is also a possibility that the people with old cars with no seat belt also may be included in this count. </p>
    <p>The highest proportion of traffic offenses were in the age group of 21-30 as well as men had a higher chance of traffic offense. Which makes sense due to car insurance being more expensive if you're young and a male then a young female. </p>

    <p>There was also less hit-and-run which means that people are more honest or they know that hit-and-runs are worse than just waiting for a cop to arrive at the scene. </p>

    <p>There were also more reports of traffic latin having the highest traffic offenses out of the ethnic groups which makes sense due them being the highest ethnic group in all of Oregon. </p>

    <p>There were also more reports of DUI in rural areas and urban areas. This could be due things like no public transportation, bars being far away from home, and lack of police enforcement. </p>

    <p>They also found many reports of Oregon State Police having the most incidents which makes sense the police force does not want to arrest anyone they just want to make sure everyone is safe. </p>
