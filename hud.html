<p>People across the country are talking about more equality and diversity.
<b> Ever since the early 60's the workplace has been very diverse but still today there are many parts of this country that are still black and white.</b> 
For instance, Meta, the company that started Facebook, recently put an algorithm in facebook which finds peoples race, sexuality, and religion.
It then puts ads on your feed to your liking.
The one problem with this is there are picking housing ads based on class, gender, and ethnicity. 
If this learning machine finds out that Hispanic people live in a certain area it is going to offer similar housing in the same zip code. 
Facebook is notorious for putting people within a box and profiling the thing they like and dislike to make users use the app more and more.
This causes people to segregate.
For instance, if we keep going in this direction we will have ethnic people living in the city while the white people will be living in the suburbs.
This is another obstacle for people with diverse backgrounds. 
Within my experience living in the suburbs I have noticed that most of my neighbors are white with only a couple people coming from diverse backgrounds as well as people with different sexual orientation.
We can not let a big corporation get away with this. 
Finally I would like to say that these learning machine must change and they should be focused on displaying housing ads in a way that promotes houses in are in your area or simply just ask the user what they looking for within their content so it personalized not on gender, race, and religion but on their the thing that they truly love.</p>
