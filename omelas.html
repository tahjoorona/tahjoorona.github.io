<h2>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas Thesis</h2>

<p>The people of Omelas have a traditional role. The men work while the women look after the kids. This causes the men to build right now while the women build and shape the generations of the future. <br></p>

<p>The festival made the people celebrate as a whole population. People were dancing, singing, or playing music. While the kids are preparing to race with the horses that are covered in gold and silver. <br></p>

<p>The city doesnâ€™t need nor like the idea of kings and queens as well as they can not stand for the stock exchange, bombs, and advertisements. There are prevalent laws within this society, however, they are not barbaric. Do you think that they even have laws?<br></p>

<p>Their society does not celebrate their accomplishments normally. They feel that they are too intellectual for happiness. Do you believe that society's accomplishments should be seen as positive change?<br></p>


<p>From the outside looking in Omelas sounds like the perfect place to live however once you arrive and lived there long enough you realize all of the horrors that come from living in a gorgeous city. Does the same thing happen when you are from a big city in America?<br></p>

<b><p>Omelas and America are not too far apart places. For many immigrants, America seems like the greatest place on earth however once they arrive they start to see the gun violence, racism, and overall disunity of this land.<br></b></p>

<p>Some places outside of this country have better technology but they still come and wish that they could forever live in Omelas. Why would you want to move to a place with no cars, helicopters, or any form of modern transportation?<br></p>

<p>Drooz, which is a drug, causes people to feel things that they have never felt before. The drug is believed to bring great vision and brilliance to people. They enjoy it and see no repercussions. However, if the drug was not appealing there was always beer. Does this mean that this drug is safe for people to consume?<br></p>

<p>People also love the idea of nudity. This idea is not just seen in adults, it is also seen in children. Why do you believe this idea is normal for adults and kids to be naked?<br></p>

<p>With all this beauty it comes at a price. In one of the nice buildings, there is a dirty locked door and behind it, there is a child who is locked in. What happens if the child is released, will cause Omelas' luscious view and great society to crash? <br></p>

<p>Many children have this kid locked behind the door and many of them think about the kid and wonder why he is not cared for. This causes the free children to be rage however, when they get older they come to terms with all the reasons why the kid is not free.<br></p>

<p>Should we save and nurture one person and destroy thousands of people's lives or should we continue on this track and see what happens to the child?<br></p>


<p>The outrage of the locked child makes people realize the horrors of this city and makes them so upset that they walk and continue walking until they have completely left the city of happiness and unity and find a new city where hopefully everyone is cared for and nurtured.<br></p>
