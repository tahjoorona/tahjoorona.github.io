<p>Throughout the last couple of years, game developers have done a great job of having the best pixel quality however, there is one thing that has not changed which is the African American hair has not changed.</p>

<p>The only options that are given for black avatars are afro and cornrows which both styles are outdated. </p>

<p>Now some video games have made a big push for making new hairstyles in the game. However, this is not for all companies. Companies with less diversity usually do not change their hairstyles.</p>

<p>Miles Morales from the Spiderman video game is one of the best examples that it is possible to have great hair within your game.</p>

<p>For the black community to have to deal with countless hair problems in the real world is ridiculous. Their hair can not just change their hair thickness or the way it looks.</p>

<p>Western Beauty standards have forced other ethnicities to change their style for others. I have been told by countless teachers that I have to cut my hair. However, this is not fair for everyone. If I am not supposed to have long hair, how can a person dye their hair?  There is nothing wrong with dying your hair however there needs to be some sort of equality.</p>

<p>Within many games, there is no recognition of black people. For instance, Babylonâ€™s Fall did not even have one black avatar to pick from.</p>

<p>Not only do African American hairstyles need to be in the video game but also the texture is important as well.</p>

<p>For many video game designers, it could be hard for them to make sure that they get these details correct especially when their company has few black employees. However, this is still not an excuse. A company could have black volunteers give their thought on a hairstyle.</p>
 
<p>Even though the thesis above is harsh towards the video game designer and anyone who makes these video games. It is clear that as a whole they are going in the correct direction. For instance, Horizon Forbidden West has done a great job of getting great texture and hair in place but at the same time if you look closely, you will see white hair textures within the beards and side fades.</p>

<p>People within the black gamers community are also taking notice. A youtube by RDCWorld1 made a video skit where a black avatar only has one hairstyle while a white avatar has many hairstyles to pick from.</p>

<p>Black hairstyles should be kept natural and the way to maintain this is by making sure that hair rules within the classroom and work environment are not driven by Western beauty standards and should have all people in mind when writing these rules.</p>


<p>It is important that when we create a black avatar we keep in mind black users that are using the game. If we fix these haircuts it could inspire someone to be a game designer and will help create a more diverse work environment.</p>
